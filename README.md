# JJsUSF4ImportExport

App based on JJsUSF4Library and IONET for converting .emo models to .dae and back again.

.emo -> .dae should work for all DIMPS engine games.

.dae -> .emo is only confirmed to work for SF4-series, but may work with others. SFxT support might be added in future if I can work out how to handle issues with vertex color.
